            <p class="label">Verse 1<p>
            <p>Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine</p>
            <p>Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all</p>
            <p>It started out with a kiss; how did it end up like this?</p>
            <p>It was only a kiss; it was only a kiss</p>
            <p>Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab</p>
            <p>While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag</p>
            <p>Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick</p>
            <p>And it's all in my head, but she's touching his</p>
            <p class="label">Pre Chorus<p>
            <p>Chest now, he takes off her</p>
            <p>Dress now, let me go</p>
            <p>And I just can't look; it's killing me</p>
            <p>They're taking control</p>
            <p class="label">Chorus<p>
            <p>Jealousy, turning saints into the sea</p>
            <p>Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis</p>
            <p>But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me</p>
            <p>Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside</p>
