         <p class=direction3><strong>1.</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 12 or 15 cup bundt pan with baking spray or butter and flour it, set aside.</p>
         <p class=direction3><strong>2.</strong> In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream butter on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add sugar and vanilla, beat until pale and fluffy <i>(~4 minutes)</i>. Add egg yolks and banana, mix until combined.</p>
         <p class=direction3><strong>3.</strong> In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</p>
         <p class=direction3><strong>4.</strong> With mixing speed on low, alternate adding the dry ingredients and the sour cream, mix just until combined.</p>
         <p class=direction3><strong>5.</strong> In a small mixing bowl with a hand mixer, whip egg whites until stiff peaks form. Using a spatula, gently fold in the egg whites to the batter.</p>
         <p class=direction3><strong>6.</strong> Pour batter into the prepared pan, smooth out into an even layer. Place in the oven and bake for 45-55 minutes or until a cake tester <i>(or toothpick)</i> inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the pan for 20 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

        <p class=direction3><strong>1.</strong> To prepare the icing, in a medium saucepan set over medium-low heat, add the butter. Cook until golden flecks begin to form at the bottom of the pan, then immediately remove from the heat. Stir in the powdered sugar, boiling water, and vanilla. Using a hand mixer, beat until frosting is easy to spread.</p>
        <p class=direction3><strong>2.</strong> Drizzle frosting over cake, then immediately sprinkle with nuts. Let set for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</p>

        <h1 class="websites">Recipe Website References</h1>
     <a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/browned-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies"><button>Tasty</button></a>
     <p class="website">I chose "Tasty" because I liked the use of columns in the website. Most recipe sites were cluttered with popups and irrelevant information, <i>(this website still has some)</i> and I found that Tasty's recipe pages had a concise way of presenting the recipe. I want to try to impliment columns in my site to break up the ingredients for the icing and cake. </p>
     <a href="https://preppykitchen.com/1448-2/"><button>Preppy Kitchen</button></a>
     <p class="website">I chose "Preppy Kitchen" because I liked the visual style of the recipe site. This recipe page stuck out to me because it presented the recipe and ingredients in a primarily visual way <i>(IE: they had images of the ingredients with captions of what the ingrident was)</i> and I liked that presentation and want to impliment that in my own site.</p>
     <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/banana-bread"><button>Bon Appetit</button></a>
     <p class="website">I chose "Bon Appetit" because they used hr breaks in a way that visually organized the page well and balanced imagery and text in a great way. Text and images felt nicely broken down into a grid like structure across the site and I think it worked well to balance visually explaining the recipe and the use of text.</p>

        <h1 class="websites">Non-Recipe Website References</h1>
     <a href="https://colossal.com"><button>Colossal</button></a>
     <p class="website">I chose "Colossal" because the use of imagery alongside icons does a really nice job of engaging the viewer as they scroll down the site. I also want to use textured backgrounds like in Colossal to add depth to my recipe page. </p>
     <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/?utm_campaign=brand_exact_prosp_ecpc_exp&gclid=CjwKCAjw4qCKBhAVEiwAkTYsPOsvTl02qLKoLu5F1bAdeAXuStSz0eEby4CGS38UcRCDprggoHha8hoCNLYQAvD_BwE"><button>The Farmer's Dog</button></a>
     <p class="website">I chose "The Farmer's Dog" becuase I liked the way that the scrolling has interactive features that adjust as you scroll down the site. I don't think I will be able to get to that level of webdesign for this project, but I want to try to use shapes and background color to break up the sections of my recipe page in a similar way to how this site is designed.</p>
     <a href="https://www.glossier.com"><button>Glossier</button></a>
     <p class="website">I chose "Glossier" because of the use of typography in the website design. There is a wide variety of type faces used in a way that is cohesive and visually interesting, and I want to try that in my website.</p>
